## This is the first refactoring challenge that i have worked on

Short description explaining the what, why, and how of my project.

- My motivation was to learn how to improve coding with better fitting semantic elements!
- For other collaberators to be able to review and work on the code in a cleaner and more sufficient way! (EASIER TO READ)
- I learned more about semantic elements and how to refact a code, as well as consolidating the style.css format.
